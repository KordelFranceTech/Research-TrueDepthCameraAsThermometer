# Research-TrueDepthCameraAsThermometer
A significant research effort showing how the TrueDepth camera on an Apple iPhone--more specifically time-of-flight sensors in general--can be reprogrammed as a thermometer. We establish our hypothesis, show our experimental setup, and analyze data obtained from experiments. The results suggest that the TrueDepth sensor has thermometric reading capabilities due to the specific part of the electromagnetic spectrum that the sensor wavelength resides in.
