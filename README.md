# Research-TrueDepthCameraAsThermometer
A significant research effort showing how the TrueDepth camera on an Apple iPhone can be reprogrammed as a thermometer. We establish our hypothesis, show our experimental setup, and analyze data obtained from experiments. The results suggest that the TrueDepth sensor--more specifically, a time-of-flight sensor--has thermometric reading capabilities due to the specific part of the electromagnetic spectrum that the sensor wavelength resides in.
